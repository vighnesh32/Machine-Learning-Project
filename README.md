# Machine-Learning-Project

File Name and Description :

1. diabetes.csv - Original data set

2. diabholdout.m - MATLAB script of descriptive statistics,EDA,partition of original data 
		          set into train and test sets (holdout method), Decision Tree model training
                          and testing, Naive Bayes model training and testing.

3. diabkfold.m - MATLAB script of descriptive statistics,EDA,partition of original data 
		          set into train and test sets (kfold method), Decision Tree model training
                          and testing, Naive Bayes model training and testing.   
4. hyperparameter.m - MATLAB script of optimization of the models.

5. testingdataDT.csv - Excel file of test data used for Decision tree model.

6. testingdataNB.csv - Excel file of test data used foe Naive Bayes model.

7. report.pdf - Project report


Sequence of running the codes :

1. Start by opening and running each section individually of the file diabholdout.m then run hyperparameter.m
   section by section for optimization.

2. After this for kfold method run file kfold.m then run hyperparameter.m for optimization.
